The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) is used.

## Notes

### Chip Version

This robot has a TB6612-chip. If this project does not work on your robot, check the microcontroller.

## Preparation

### Libraries

The project relies on libraries to function. These libraries are in the directory `CopyMeFirst`.

Instructions to add those libraries to your Arduino IDE can be found here: `CopyMeFirst/AddLibraries.pdf`.
